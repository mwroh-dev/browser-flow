# Browser Flow

Scope: model-facing skill entry. Primary authority for HOW the LLM walks
the four pipeline phases. Layer/role authority lives in
the projected views at `agents/{name}/AGENT.md`.
Internal sub-agent skills live under `skills/{name}/`; runtime
code lives under `runtime/scripts/`. Installation must not copy
those directories to the host project root.

Single-entry Codex and Claude skill for capturing local browser workflows and producing verified artifacts.

Load `prompt.md` for the LLM instruction set. Load references from `references/` only at the relevant pipeline stage — see `manifest.json` for the reference list.
